# -----------------------Starting with Print Function--------------------------

# example:1
x : str = 'NA Times'
print(x) # print
print(type(x)) # type
print(id(x)) # physcial address

# x : str = 'NA Times' # variable 'x', type 'string', assign 'NA Times'
# In quotation any thing become "String".
# single quotation (''), Double quotation ("")

abc = 'Muhammad Asif'
abc = 7
print(abc)

# Previously we do a code like this
# In this code python not give error and run without error but when you 
# - work on large application it create a problem. code crash.
# so we do a work from developer you make a particular variable in which also particular type also store.

# Now we see some other example of print.

# example:2
a : str = 'MOJO For everyone'
print(a)

# example:3
b : int = 1 + 6
print(b)

# example:4
c : bool = True
print(c)



# ----------------------------- commit in python --------------
# ctrl + question mark(?) or forward slash(/)
# shift + Hashtag(#)

print('NA TIMES') 
print('NA TIMES')
print('NA TIMES')
print('NA TIMES')
print('NA TIMES')

# MULTI LINE COMMIT is done triple quotation is used for saving information keywords.

# ---------------------Further code in Jupyter notebook -----------------

# In AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Generative AI we have complex Algorithm which
# - take lot of time to execute. In .py file when we change in the code we run entire code again,
# - but jupyter note book give us benefit to run the code in chunk, If we run the 7 hour code
# - 1 time when we do changes in it so we not need to run it again.

print('NA TIMES') # 1 sec
print('NA TIMES')
print('NA TIMES')
print('NA TIMES') # 7 hour (update or error in code)
print('NA TIMES')
